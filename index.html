Another year is a happy gift,
So cut your cake, and say,
"Instead of counting birthdays,
I count blessings every day!"
So happy birthday to you 
From the bottom of my heart🫂🧿🤞🏻🫀.
And may your good times multiply,
Till they're flying off the chart!
I wanted to present you with stars for your birthday. But their shine can’t match yours. Keep shining on your birthday and always!💗᪲᪲᪲
I may not be the first one to wish you a happy birthday. But I wish to be the only one to reside in your celebration❥◕⩊◕🌸
Happy Birthday
